# JodelCity
Python Script to Download Pictures and Videos

IMPORTANT
ONLY Testet on LINUX with Python 3.7
This provides a script to download all pictues on jodelCity
Supportet are jpg pictures and mp4 video
To work all below packages must be installed and the chrome or firefoc webdriver.
The driver must be in your PATH. (Chrome is much faster)

KNOWN BUGS:   This Script does not get all the pics. JodelCity only loads the first 80
              or so comments. So only the pics within thes loaded comments will be found.
              
              TODO: Scroll the page and wit to load all comments and pic IDs
              Somtimes the dirver chraches without a abvious reason. Just restart the Script
