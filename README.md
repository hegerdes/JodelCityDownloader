# JodelCity
Python Script to Download Pictures and Videos

IMPORTANT
ONLY Testet on LINUX with Python 3.7

This provides a script to download all pictues on jodelCity

Supportet are jpg pictures and mp4 video

To work all below packages must be installed and the chrome or firefoc webdriver.
The driver must be in your PATH. (Chrome is much faster)

KNOWN BUGS: 

               Now all Pictures in the entire channel gets Downloaded but not all videos               
               TODO Make sure the video ID is loaded

               This Script does not get all the pics. JodelCity only loads the first 80
               or so comments. So only the pics within thes loaded comments will be found.
               SOLVED

               Somtimes the dirver chraches without a abvious reason. Just restart the Script
               SOLVED
